The new users have to create an account by clicking "Don't have an account? Sign Up". A new user has to enter an username, email address, and password to set up an account.

The current prototype of the I3 data marketplace did not undergo a security audit, therefore, we recommend the users not to reuse the username and password from online platforms.
